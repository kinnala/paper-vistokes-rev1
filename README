This repository contains numerical experiments for the paper
"Stabilised finite element method for Stokes problem with nonlinear
slip condition" by Tom Gustafsson and Juha Videman.

The numerical experiments have been performed using Python 3.9.6
interpreter by executing the file "convergence2.py" with a command

>> python3 convergence.py

This will write the output files to "figs/".

We expect any version of the Python interpreter between 3.8 and 3.11
to work equally well.

Package dependencies are used by the source code in "convergence2.py"
and "uzawa.py".  These dependencies are listed in "requirements.txt"
file.  Assuming that all the dependecies are still available in PyPI
or some other package repository, the most straightforward way to
install these dependencies is by running

>> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Expecting that in future at least some of the dependency versions
might become unavailable, we have downloaded the dependencies for
Python 3.9 and some of the popular platforms (at the time of writing)
and included them within the Zenodo archive of this repository under
"deps/".

This has been achieved by running commands such as

>> python3 -m pip download \
           -r requirements.txt \
           -d deps/manylinux2014_x86_64 \
	   --platform manylinux2014_x86_64 \
	   --only-binary=:all:

This directory of dependencies can be used during installation as
follows:

>> python3 -m pip install \
           --no-index \
	   -f ./deps/manylinux2014_x86_64 \
	   -r requirements.txt

In case the platforms have become unavailable, the best option is to
rely on virtualization of one of the platforms.
